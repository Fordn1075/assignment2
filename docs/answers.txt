1. Inheritance is when a class is related to a parent class and then can use the public or protected variables or methods related to the parent class.
Polymorphism means that a parent class can react differenctly based on the reference to a subclass or type.
Encapsulation is also known as information hiding and it is when you make variables of a class private, and they can onyl be accessed through getters and setters.

With Integration Manager workflow the developers only work with their own versions of the code, and submit it to a integration manager;then they will solve the conflicts
	before pushing the changes to the blessed repository.
With Dictator and Lieutenants workflow the developers push their changes to lieutenants who will then merge the changes for some of the developers and then push their work
	to the dictator who will then do the same with the lieutenants work. The dictator will then push their work to the blessed repository.

(j)
Instead of one person dealing with 99 different versions and trying to merge, and solve conflicts of all 99 versions, the work can be split up into a tree.
	 Where groups of 4 people whose work is given to one person 1, who in turn works with a group for 4 people with similar jobs, to give their work to one person to merge.
